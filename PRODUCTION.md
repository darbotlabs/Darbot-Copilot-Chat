- Implement rate limiting and request throttling
- Set up API key management for external services
- Enable request/response logging for audit trails

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper secret management (Azure Key Vault recommended)
- Configure proper database connection encryption
- Set up regular security scans and vulnerability assessments

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Backend Configuration
